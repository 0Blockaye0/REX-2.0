  ## Usage

  When first visiting the site, the user is brought to the homepage where all the available dogs are displayed. A user may filter the dogs data by size, and select to view on its own page. For any further user interaction, the user will need to sign up. once an account is created with a first & last name, email & password, the user may choose to submit an application. The submit simply adds the dog to a cart (located in the doghouse icon on the top right of the screen if on a large display, and center on smaller devices). When the user chooses to checkout, the application submision and the fee are itemized and displayed with a credit card form provided by Stripe. The Stripe functionality is in test mode for obvious reasons. I beleive this application serves as a great starting place/ template for an online store.
